				<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m <span class="bold">David Scaliatine.</span> I&#39;m a senior UX designer and leader
					with <span class="experience">10</span> years of experience channeling my curiosity and tendency to collect bits of knowledge along my journey into holistic user-centered solutions.</p>

				<p>I started down the traditional path of a graphic designer: right into marketing for different organizations. Throughout my tenure, I brought to life multiple marketing campaigns and
					componentsthrough the use of unique headlines, copywriting, art direction, and user experience. The
					mostfulfilling time was leading and inspiring designers to take their ideas from conception
					toimplementation.</p>

				<p>Now working as a user experience designer, you can often hear me asking questions that seem out ofthe
					blue but are used to build context or make connections to other projects happening elsewhere. I have
					a weakness for clever puns and use my approximate knowledge of many things to bring in the right
					people, who are way smarter than me, at the right time.</p>

				<p><strike>In my spare time.</strike> I run a murder mystery business named <a
						href="https://www.bakerstreetmystery.com" target="_blank">Baker Street Mystery.</a> I recently
					achieved an MFA in communication designwith a focus on examining how personal narratives, shared
					from the LGBTQ+ community, impact self-esteem and how the stories help create empathy to learn from
					and connect with others. You can <a class="nostyle" href="thesis.html">read more about it here</a>.
