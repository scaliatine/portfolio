<div class="intro">
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m <span class="bold">David Scaliatine.</span> I&#39;m a senior UX designer and leader with 10 years of experience channeling my curiosity and tendency to collect bits of knowledge along my journey into holistic user-centered solutions.</p>

<p>I started down the traditional path of a graphic designer: right into marketing for different organizations. Throughout my tenure, I brought to life multiple marketing campaigns and components through the use of unique headlines, copywriting, art direction, and user experience. The most fulfilling time was leading and inspiring designers to take their ideas from conception to implementation.</p>

<p>Now working as a user experience designer, you can often hear me asking questions that seem out of the blue but are used to build context or make connections to other projects happening elsewhere. I have a weakness for clever puns and use my approximate knowledge of many things to bring in the right people, who are way smarter than me, at the right time.</p>

<p><strike>In my spare time.</strike> I run a murder mystery business named <a href="https://www.bakerstreetmystery.com" target="_blank">Baker Street Mystery.</a> I recently achieved an MFA in communication design and working on my thesis. Examining how personal narratives, shared from the LGBTQ+ community, impact self-esteem and how the stories help create empathy to learn from and connect with others. You can <a class="nostyle" href="thesis.html">read more about it here</a>.</p>
