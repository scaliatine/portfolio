            <div class="col-12 mb-2 mt-1">
                <p>Stories, and specifically as a focus in this thesis, personal narratives, can be so much more than
                    just
                    words shared on a page, bound in books, collecting dust on library shelves. They are vivid memories,
                    lost voices, and epic journeys. A well-timed story can create a movement, quell a storm and spark a
                    revolution. They connect our experiences and become our legacy. When we listen to a story, we build
                    a
                    connection with the storyteller. As their narrative unfolds, a shared understanding is built through
                    learning and establishing our self-conscience to relate to one another. Keen (207) describes this as
                    narrative empathy, which is a pivotal step in understanding someone else&rsquo;s point-of-view,
                    struggles, and perseverance. When we listen to a poignant story and share it with others, we allow
                    it to
                    be strengthened in our memories and <span class="highlight">eventually shift our ideals, beliefs,
                        and
                        interactions.</span></p>


                <p>Furthermore, listening to stories from or of people who mirror yourself, experiences and environment
                    can
                    impact your ideals. This can shift who you want to be and how you want to be perceived by others,
                    resulting in an impact on self-esteem (&ldquo;Erik Erikson: The Search for Self-Identity.&rdquo;).
                    Our
                    reaction to stories is more than psychological; it is physiological as well. Research shows that
                    <span class="highlight simplehighlight">the more the listener of a story connects and understands
                        the
                        story from the storyteller&rsquo;s perspective, the more likely the listener&rsquo;s brain waves
                        would mirror the person telling the story</span> (Stephens et al.). If stories impact our
                    beliefs
                    and how we relate and connect with others, we must ensure there is a representation of a range of
                    people
                    and experiences.
                </p>

                <p>In mainstream narratives, underserved communities, such as those who identify as queer or LGBTQIA+,
                    can
                    often be regulated to simplified depictions of either negative, non-affirming ways or typical tropes
                    and
                    stereotypes. This absence of fully realized and true representation is often referred to as relative
                    invisibility, <span class="highlight simplehighlight">in which there may not be a lack of
                        representation
                        in general, there is however, an absence of abundant positive representations</span> (Fryberg
                    and
                    Townsend). In a 2011 study of GLB individuals regarding how media influenced self-realization,
                    respondents frequently requested a desire to see realistic depictions of queer individuals
                    (Gomillion
                    and Giuliano). Arguably realistic is a word that could be interpreted many different ways, yet more
                    often than not these narratives focus on coming out, familial struggles, or the lense of the
                    flamboyant
                    gay friend. While the former of the contexts can be relevant to the queer experience, it is not the
                    only
                    aspect. It fails to showcase an individual as a whole, missing out on building empathy through
                    intersectionality.</p>

                <p>Eventually, it results in an incomplete embodiment of the individual and increased difficulty in
                    building
                    narrative empathy. When this happens, it could suggest that <span
                        class="highlight simplehighlight">queer individuals can be perceived with stigmatization,
                        discrimination, or marginalization from non-queer populations, causing queer storytellers to
                        have a
                        lower perceived value and lower self-esteem</span>. Even from a young age, LGBTQIA+ individuals
                    experience more significant mental health issues than their straight counterparts.</p>

                <p>Additionally, in examining longitudinal studies, it has been shown that LGBTQIA+ individuals have
                    lower
                    self-esteem levels (Bridge et al.). And while many different elements factor into these issues, such
                    as
                    familial struggles, religious persecution, discrimination, self-realization, amongst others, it can
                    be
                    extrapolated that overall the cause of low self-esteem is shared experiences unique to this
                    underrepresented group, compared to their straight counterparts. Additionally, trends in lower
                    self-esteem and higher rates of mental health issues, in general, continue to trend significantly
                    higher
                    than other heterosexual groups. This examination provides the preliminary context that
                    underrepresentation of queer stories can be one of the many factors to lower self-esteem and an
                    association with problematic mental wellness.</p>

            <h3 class="col-12 mb-1 mt-5">The Problem</h3>
            <div class="col-12 mb-2 mt-1">
                <p>Let us take a moment to consider how storytelling permeates into a digital landscape for queer
                    individuals. Given that digital spaces allow for widespread aggregation and reach larger audiences,
                    there is no lack of availability of LGBTQIA+ friendly websites and apps. However, with exceptions,
                    the
                    primary purpose of the majority is casual hooking up or finding a long-term romantic relationship,
                    creating a representation gap in queer storytelling platforms. This becomes problematic as there
                    aren&rsquo;t enough social connection platforms for queer individuals under 25 years old, who often
                    use
                    digital means to seek a social connection and support of others (Baams et al.).</p>

                <p>Lex: Queer Lovers and Friends, one popular app, is self-described as a social app that connects queer
                    lovers and friends. However, categorically within the app store, it is listed as a dating app. The
                    marketing language explicitly states their driving purpose is to find a steamy date beyond a profile
                    picture. By not having a clear focus on either dating or social, their conflating intent muddies the
                    app&rsquo;s purpose. Another app, Amino, one of the few created for social connection, features
                    multiple
                    channels or groups to join with a large selection of LGBTQIA+ options. However, their non-curated
                    format
                    creates a space mixed with memes, recycled Tumblr posts, and its interface design is hard to
                    navigate.
                    Other websites focused explicitly on storytelling, like StoryCorps, highlight crafted and structured
                    personal narratives. However, in StoryCorps, only 4% of their 60,000 professional recorded stories
                    focus
                    on the experience or specifically identify LGBTQIA+ individuals.</p>

                <p>To say all LGBTQIA+ focused and friendly sites fall into a few categories such as dating, casual
                    hookups,
                    or news and gossip&mdash;would be incorrect, as this is a cursory categorization at sites and apps
                    available. It would also be remiss not to acknowledge both digital and physical mediums explicitly
                    created for and by the queer community. Digital collections such as the LGBTQ Digital Collaboratory,
                    which is updated regularly, features over 40 different websites focused on oral histories. While the
                    large majority of initiatives are working sites, many tied to higher education institutions, the
                    aggregate list contains broken or missing links. There are plenty of active sites in the previous
                    example and more, this thesis plans to expand on the foundation set be such sites.</p>

                <p>Physical publications like newspapers, magazines, and zines have filled the gaps of underrepresented
                    voices for years. Often started in grassroots and underground settings, these periodicals featuring
                    LGBTQIA+ news and narratives continue to impact readers today. These physical pieces usually come
                    with a
                    limitation of reach and accessibility, requiring a subscription and lacking the anonymity of digital
                    spaces. Unfortunately,<span class="highlight "> there are few digital spaces dedicated to
                        LGBTQIA+ individuals outside of dating, hookups, celebrity, and entertainment.</span> Without
                    ubiquitous platforms dedicated to destigmatizing queer stories and building empathy between and
                    within
                    the underserved communities, LGBTQIA+ individuals will continue to see greater rates of low
                    self-esteem
                    and mental health issues.</p>

            <h3 class="col-12 mb-1 mt-5">The Hypothesis</h3>
            <div class="col-12 mb-2 mt-1">
                <p>This thesis seeks to examine how a digital platform can portray, amplify, and <span
                    class="highlight ">represent queer stories through an interactive digital story
                    collection to build a stronger narrative empathy between storytellers and listeners.</span> Stronger
                narrative empathy and emotional bonds have been seen to have a significant impact on increased
                self-esteem and suggested that a digital storytelling platform targeted towards the queer community will
                have the same positive effects (Hahm et al.).</p>

            <p>In the context of this study, a queer story is any personal story shared by an LGBTQIA+ person, in which
                their experience has had a significant impact. Including, but not exclusive to, coming out,
                transitioning, LGBTQIA+ legislation, pride, insurance, families, relationships, health, and wellness,
                etc. This thesis focuses on capturing these <span class="highlight ">realistic portrayals
                    of moments impacted by their queer experiences and showcasing them on a digital platform</span>.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <h3 class="col-12 mb-1 mt-5">Methodology and Outcome</h3>
            <div class="col-12 mb-2 mt-1">
                <p>To collect stories that examine viewpoints beyond generalized queer tropes, such as the flamboyant gay or
                    the troubled queer, and to increase the normalization of stories from an intersection of people, there
                    will be a series of unstructured interviews with self-consenting subjects identified through a survey.
                    After the project is available publicly, individuals&rsquo; self-esteem will be measured using the
                    Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (VII. Appendix) to determine the effect of storytelling and listening to a
                    personal story on self-esteem.</p>
    
                <p>An outcome of this thesis will be a measurable impact on storytellers&rsquo; and listeners&rsquo; empathy
                    and self-esteem. While measuring the impact on an individual&#39;s self-esteem will be one measure, it
                    is not the primary objective of this thesis. Instead, the <span class="highlight ">main
                        outcome will be an interactive story collection on a digital platform that allows LGBTQIA+
                        individuals to share a part of their experience with others</span>. This digital story collection
                    will create a new affirming space solely focused on amplifying underserved voices and encouraging others
                    to do the same.</p>
